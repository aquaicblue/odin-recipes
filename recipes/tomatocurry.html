    <h3>What Is It?</h3>
    <p>This recipe is my own personal spin on the classic Japanese Curry. What's unique here is the addition of tomato, which 
        provides an extra layer of depth and sweetness. I've tried a plethora of Japanese curry recipes, and this is by
        far my favorite variation. It's super customizable too; feel free to add your own favorite vegetables and seasonings! </p>
