    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        You know it, you love it. This is the one and only Lily Chan's TKG. 
    </p>
    <p>For those who are unfamiliar, TKG stands for <em>Tamago Kake Gohan</em></p>
    <p>A classic Japanese meal with a Lily Chan twist! And what might that twist be? </p>
    <p>We cook the egg. That's it. That's the twist.</p>
    <p> The truth is I hate <em>neba neba</em>, so that's the only reason why I cook the egg. If you like 
    raw eggs, maybe just do it the normal way? It's really up to you!</p>

        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>

    </ul>

        <li>Place egg on top of hot rice</li>
